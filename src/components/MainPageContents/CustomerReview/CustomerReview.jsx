Yes, word of mouth about his professionalism amongst our families spread like a wild fire and he is terribly busy these days. He is growing fast through his hard work and adeptness. However, this is my first feedback about him to the outside world after he has done photography for my daughter's blooming ceremony in Coimbatore in May 2024! Yes, my feedback took time and hence is solid!`,
